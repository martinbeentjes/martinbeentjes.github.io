As of the 16th of March the whole office is working from home. I would like to remind you of a small set of ideas to remind yourself of to keep doing.

## Stay hydrated
Keep a bottle of water close and keep drinking your water. Staying hydrated is important and keeps you smiling.

## Do not wear comfly clothing when working
To keep yourself reminded that you are working and thus in a different space, wear the clothing you would wear to work as well. Do not wear comfortable clothing or work in your pyjama's because you are at home. You are still working so adapt to that.

## Take your usual breaks
Stand up, walk around the house, run up and down the stairs a couple of times. When you have your lunch planned, take a walk outside. Breath in some fresh air, enjoy the sun. Do not stay inside the whole day.
