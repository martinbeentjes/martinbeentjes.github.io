Welcome to the first part in a series on build a fullstack web application. This series is going to cover the process of building an event registration system, from the database to the frontend and the whole process of doing so!

I am a backend engineer from origin. I want to grow towards being fullstack engineer. Besides the fullstack, I also want to understand how to design user interfaces. 

In this series we will cover several subjects:

 * Learn the process of building a production ready software application from scratch
 * How to build a Spring Boot backend API with a frontend
 * Implement a frontend framework as React or Vue
 * Learn to create a decent user interface
 * Build beautiful APIs 
 * How to deploy our application
