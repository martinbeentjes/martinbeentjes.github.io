In this series we are going to build an backend service using Ktor. In this part the service is going to be implemented


The Ktor Project Generator is used to generate basic setup for our project 

 * ktor-auth-jwt for authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) 
 * ktor-jackson or ktor-gson for json handling

The application will be handing the serving of products, therefore we need to return a list of json objects and based upon the scopes inside the jwt we know what the user may do (read, or also write and update information)
