## Introduction
Spring Boot is the standard framework for backend services. Ktor is a web framework written in Kotlin. In this series we will explore trying out Ktor instead of Spring. 

Every backend service I write is in Kotlin with Spring Boot. I prefer Kotlin over Java because Kotlin is less verbose and much more concise. 

## Goals of this series

Time is not invested randomly. We invest time in tbis project for several reasons. The following goals are set for this series to be answered. 

### Developer experience

As a developer writing Spring applications is really straight forward  and easy. How is that experience with Ktor? Is it as intuitive as  Spring Boot?

### Performance measurements

 - What is the performance of a Ktor application versus a Spring Boot application? 
 - What are the resource characteristics of both? 
 - What is the throughput of a single instance? 

### Gaining knowledge

Besides that we will also gain knowledge  about doing such experiments. And sharing is caring, thus we share  the knowledge we have gathered in the process.
