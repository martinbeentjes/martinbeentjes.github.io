## From the Backend towards SRE

In September of 2018 I joined Albert Heijn as a Backend Engineer working with a JVM backend (first Java, nowadays mostly Kotlin). I have been working in the same team for the past 18 months. The team did tremendous work on improving the Bonus page (showing all discounted products).

In November of 2019 I got in touch with a colleague who is the Lead on SRE within our department. After some conversations it got me hooked. 

Joining our Site Reliability Team will help me learn to understand the operational part of building delivering software like Albert Heijn does.
