Hi! I am Martin, a 24 year old software engineer writing about my life, work and ideas I have on this blog. Currently, I am working as a DevOps Engineer for [Albert Heijn](https://ah.nl/). Albert Heijn is one of the biggest grocery stores in The Netherlands. We do ecommerce, and it is awesome. Let me tell you a little bit about myself.

I studied Computer Science at InHolland University of Applied Sciences in Alkmaar. At the course I mainly focused on engineering robots and the software for those robots. One of the graduation projects I attended was a robotic system for sorting coloured tennis balls. The system runs on a real time variant of Minix 3. We changed Minix to let it support realtime. This change was partially succesful.

In the proces of building that robot, I learned the love for building challenging projects. After my study I started working for a small company in Alkmaar where I left after around one year. When leaving that company I started looking for a new place to work. Albert Heijn stood out, I was sold on it.

We build amazing things with new technology, and I love the freedom I get to develop new things. Albert Heijn gives me the space develop myself as an Engineer and as a person.
